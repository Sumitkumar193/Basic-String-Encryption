# Basic-String-Encryption
Basic String Encryption application will encrypt the desired text into cypher and decrypt.

String encryption application uses basic cypher ('Key') to generate encrypted texts and decryption of messages.

Note:
  For enhanced encryption change the "key" string to new randomized string to generate more complex cypher texts.
